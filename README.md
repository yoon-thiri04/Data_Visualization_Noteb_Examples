# Data Visualization Examples with Jupyter Notebook

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating how to create and decorate various types of plots using `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scipy`.
These examples are designed to help beginners understand the basics of data visualization.

This repository contains three main files:

1. **Histogram, plot, scatter, subplots**:
    - Demonstrates how to create and decorate histograms, plots, scatter plots, and subplots.
    - Includes examples of adding annotations such as grid lines, legends, shared axes (`sharex=True`), density plots, arrows, markers, and text to the diagrams.
    - Perfect for users who are new to data visualization and want to see how different functions and methods work.

2. **NormalDistribution Example**:
    - Provides examples of generating normal distribution data using `numpy`'s `np.random.normal`.
    - Demonstrates how to create histograms and plots with the generated data.
    - Useful for understanding how normal distribution works and how to visualize it without using real-world data.
    - Note: If you want to test these examples with real numbers, please check out the separate repository on Binomial and Normal Distribution linked [here](#).

3. **CDF of Z-Score Example**:
    - An example of computing the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the z-score for a normal distribution with sample data.
